## Important ##
If something does not work - restart Sublime Text!

# What's new: #
- respect `hide_default_completions` also when there are completions from this plugin. See issue #55.
- install message is a bit better now.

## Thanks ##
It is really important for me that you are using the plugin. If you have
problems - submit issues and we will eventually solve them together.

If you like the plugin, consider supporting the development! It takes me quite
some time to implement everything as good as I can. Find ways to support the
plugin here: https://github.com/niosus/EasyClangComplete#support-it
