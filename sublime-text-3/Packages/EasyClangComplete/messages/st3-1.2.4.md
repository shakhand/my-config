## Important ##
If something does not work - restart Sublime Text!

# What's new: #
- update flags from `.clang_complete` on the fly if this file has changed since the last time it was seen by the plugin.
- code base cleanups
- minor bug fixes

## Thanks ##
It is really important for me that you are using the plugin. If you have
problems - submit issues and we will eventually solve them together.

If you like the plugin, consider supporting the development! It takes me quite
some time to implement everything as good as I can. Find ways to support the
plugin here: https://github.com/niosus/EasyClangComplete#support-it
