What's new:

- Now there is a new setting: `use_project_specific_settings` to set the clang flags for the current project from the `*.sublime-project` file. The flags have to be under `settings` -> `clang_flags` in the correspondent json file.
- Example project file looks like this:
```
{
    "folders":
    [
        {
            "path": "."
        }
    ],
    "settings":
    {
        "clang_flags": ["-std=c++11", "-I/usr/include"]
    }
}
```

If the file that you are working on now does not belong to the project, or if the project has no `clang_flags` key under `settings` then the plugin should fall back to classic execution.

By defult this new setting is `false`.
