## Important ##
If something does not work - restart Sublime Text!

# What's new: #
- setting triggers automatically in `User Preferences` was probably a bad
  decision. It complicated the structure of the plugin and caused confusion for
  users.
- this behavior is gone now. The triggers are instead defined in internal to
  the plugin `Preferences.sublime-settings`.
- you can find them from command pallet now:
    + press `Ctrl + Shift + P`
    + pick: "EasyClangComplete: open completion triggers location"
    + just typing `ot`, should be enough for this
- some more bug fixes

It is really important for me that you are using the plugin. If you have
problems - submit issues and we will eventually solve them together.

If you like the plugin, consider supporting the development! It takes me quite
some time to implement everything as good as I can. Find ways to support the
plugin here: https://github.com/niosus/EasyClangComplete#support-it
