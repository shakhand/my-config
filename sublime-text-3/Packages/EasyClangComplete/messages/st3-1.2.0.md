What's new:
- updated the way to search for `libclang` library file on different systems.
  **Important**: If you could use `libclang` method and it has broken - please
  report in on Github.
- now using `view.buffer_id()` instead of `view.id()` to detect if a buffer has
  completions ready.
- the plugin will not search for default `cindex` as it is incompatible with
  python 3
