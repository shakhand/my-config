What's new:

- `libclang` would not complete STL in standalone `.h` files because they would
  be detected as `C` files instead of `C++`. This is fixed now by using sublime
  syntax definitions.
- Generally use syntax provided by sublime instead of checking the file
  extension.
- Minor code refactorings.
