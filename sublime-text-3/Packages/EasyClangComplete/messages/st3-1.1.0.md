What's new:
- OSX now uses `libclang` by default. You can use your default clang
  installation or install llvm version from brew.
- Fix for using `libclang` with `clang-3.8` on Linux.
- Fix a bug where a file that has syntax C++ but was never saved before would
  generate errors.
- Add unit tests for completions using `libclang` for OSX and Linux.

Big thanks go to users:
- @Ventero for fixing `libclang` search on OSX
- @riazanovskiy for hints on `clang-3.8`
