# What's new: #
- the sublime completion triggers will be automatically set for you if the plugin detects that they are not configured properly. It will ask you before though. So you can say no (although, why would you?)
- the plugin should be able to find `libclang.dll` on Windows now. The method using libclang is still in development. Please consider helping me out on this by reporting your errors on issue #4, here: https://github.com/niosus/EasyClangComplete/issues/4

## Thanks ##
It is really important for me that you are using the plugin. If you have problems - submit issues and we will eventually solve them together.

If you likt the plugin, consider supporting the development here: https://github.com/niosus/EasyClangComplete#support-it
