What's new:
- new setting `auto_set_sublime_triggers` to match sublime text settings for
  `auto_complete_triggers` with the ones defined by this package. It should not
  break anything, so it is now `true` by default allowing for a more easy setup
  of the plugin.
- better handling of triggers. Now default sublime completions will be present
  in all cases apart from situations where the user is typing a float number
  like `42.` or when using partial trigger like `>` or `:`. These situations will show nothing.
